### Common Variable Combinations
<a name="vartypes"></a>

* 1 discrete
* 1 continuous
* 2 discrete
* 2 continuous
* 1 discrete, 1 continuous
* 3 continuous

<p class="alert alert-info">Before you read ahead, come up with an example of 
each type of variable combination and sketch the types of graphs that would 
best display these data.</p> 

### Data

Here we've created some data frames with different types of data. 

* `pets` has a column with pet type
* `demog` has `height` and `age` for 500 men and 500 women.
* `x_vs_y` has two correlated continuous variables (`x` and `y`)
* `overlap` has two correlated ordinal variables and 1000 observations so there is a lot of overlap
* `overplot` has two correlated continuous variables and 10000 observations

First, think about what kinds of graphs are best for representing these different types of data.

```{r}

pets <- tibble(
  pet = sample(
    c("dog", "cat", "ferret", "bird", "fish"), 
    100, 
    TRUE, 
    c(0.45, 0.40, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05)
  )
)

demog <- tibble(
  sex = rep(c("male", "female"), each = 500),
  height = c(rnorm(500, 70, 4), rnorm(500, 65, 3.5)),
  age = rpois(1000, 3) + 20
)

x_vs_y <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = x + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)
)

overlap <- tibble(
  x = rbinom(1000, 10, 0.5),
  y = x + rbinom(1000, 20, 0.5)
)

overplot <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = x + rnorm(10000, 0, 0.5)
)

```


### Bar plot
<a name="geom_bar"></a>
Bar plots are good for categorical data where you want to represent the count.

```{r barplot}
ggplot(pets, aes(pet)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Density plot
<a name="geom_density"></a>
Density plots are good for one continuous variable, but only if you have a fairly 
large number of observations.

```{r density}

ggplot(demog, aes(height)) +
  geom_density()

```

You can represent subsets of a variable by assigning the category variable to 
the argument `group`, `fill`, or `color`. 

```{r density-sex}

ggplot(demog, aes(height, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

```

<p class="alert alert-info">Try changing the `alpha` argument to figure out what 
it does.</p>


### Frequency Polygons
<a name="geom_freqpoly"></a>
If you don't want smoothed distributions, try `geom_freqpoly()`.

```{r freqpoly}

ggplot(demog, aes(height, color = sex)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
  
```

<p class="alert alert-info">Try changing the `binwidth` argument to 5 and 0.1. 
How do you figure out the right value? </p>

### Histogram
<a name="geom_histogram"></a>
Histograms are also good for one continuous variable, and work well if you don't 
have many observations. Set the `binwidth` to control how wide each bar is.

```{r histogram}

ggplot(demog, aes(height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "white", color = "black")
  
```

If you show grouped histograms, you also probably want to change the default 
`position` argument.

```{r histogram-sex}

ggplot(demog, aes(height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5, position = "dodge")
  
```

<p class="alert alert-info">Try changing the `position` argument to "identity", 
"fill", "dodge", and "stack".</p>

### Boxplot
<a name="geom_boxplot"></a>
Boxplots are great for representing the distribution of grouped continuous 
variables. They fix most of the problems with using barplots for continuous data.

```{r boxplot}

ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)

```

### Violin plot
<a name="geom_violin"></a>
Violin pots are like sideways, mirrored density plots. They give even more information 
than a boxplot about distribution and are especially useful when you have non-normal 
distributions.

```{r violin}

ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), 
    alpha = 0.5
  )

```

<p class="alert alert-info">Try changing the numbers in the `draw_quantiles` 
argument.</p>


```{r stat-summary}

ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = function(x) {
      m <- mean(x)
      sd <- sd(x)
      
      c(y    = m,
        ymin = m - sd,
        ymax = m + sd)
    }, 
    geom="pointrange")

```
 


### Violinbox plot

To demonstrate the use of `facet_grid()` for factorial designs, I created a new 
column called `agegroup` to split the data into participants older than the 
meadian age or younger than the median age.

```{r violinbox}

demog %>%
  mutate(agegroup = ifelse(age<median(age), "Younger", "Older")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
    geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.25, fill="white") +
    facet_grid(.~agegroup) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "green"))

```

<p class="alert alert-info">Set the `show.legend` argument to `FALSE` to hide the 
legend. We do this here because the x-axis already labels the sexes.</p>

### Violin-jitter plot

If you don't have a lot of data points, it's good to represent them individually. 
You can use `geom_point` to do this, setting `position` to "jitter".

```{r violin-jitter}

demog %>%
  sample_n(50) %>%  # choose 50 random observations from the dataset
  ggplot(aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), 
    alpha=0.5
  ) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7, size = 3)

```

### Column plot
<a name="geom_col"></a>
Column plots are the worst way to represent grouped continuous data, but also 
one of the most common.

To make column plots with error bars, you first need to calculate the means, 
error bar uper limits (`ymax`) and error bar lower limits (`ymin`) for each 
category. You'll learn more about how to use the code below in the next two lessons.

```{r colplot}

# calculate mean and SD for each sex
demog %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(height),
    sd = sd(height)
  ) %>%
ggplot(aes(sex, mean, fill=sex)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 40)

```

<p class="alert alert-info">What do you think `geom_hline()` does?</p>

### Save as File
<a name="ggsave"></a>
You can save a ggplot using `ggsave()`. It saves the last ggplot you made, 
by default, but you can specify which plot you want to save if you assigned that 
plot to a variable.

You can set the `width` and `height` of your plot. The default units are inches, 
but you can change the `units` argument to "in", "cm", or "mm".


```{r, eval = FALSE}

demog_box <- ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)

demog_violin <- ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5)

ggsave("demog_violin_plot.png", width = 5, height = 7)

ggsave("demog_box_plot.jpg", plot = demog_box, width = 5, height = 7)

```

### Grid of plots
<a name="cowplot"></a>
You can use the [ `cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) 
package to easily make grids of different graphs. First, you have to assign each 
plot a name. Then you list all the plots as the first arguments of `plot_grid()` 
and provide a list of labels.

<a name="theme"></a>
You can get back the default ggplot theme with `+ theme_set(theme_grey())`.

```{r cowplot}

library(cowplot)

my_hist <- ggplot(demog, aes(height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 1, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "dodge", 
    show.legend = FALSE
  )

my_violin <- ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(
    trim = FALSE,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.5), 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    show.legend = FALSE
  )

my_box <- ggplot(demog, aes(sex, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE)

my_density <- ggplot(demog, aes(height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, show.legend = FALSE)

my_bar <- demog %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(height),
    sd = sd(height)
  ) %>%
ggplot(aes(sex, mean, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = 0.25)

plot_grid(
  my_violin, 
  my_box, 
  my_density, 
  my_bar, 
  labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D")
)

```

<p class="alert alert-info">Once you load the cowplot package, your ggplot 
default theme will change.</p>

### Scatter plot
<a name="geom_point"></a>
Scatter plots are a good way to represent the relationship between two continuous variables.

```{r scatter}

ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Line graph
<a name="geom_smooth"></a>
You often want to represent the relationship as a single line.

```{r line}
ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

### Scatter-line graph

If your graph isn't too complicated, it's good to also show the individual data 
points behind the line.

```{r scatter_line}

ggplot(x_vs_y, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
  

```

### Overlapping Discrete Data
<a name="overlap"></a>
You can deal with overlapping data points (very common if you're using Likert scales) by reducing the opacity of the points. You need to use trial and error to adjust these so they look right.

```{r overlap_alpha}

ggplot(overlap, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = .05) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

<a name="geom_count"></a>
Or you can set the size of the dot proportional to the number of overlapping 
observations using `geom_count()`.

```{r overlap_size}

overlap %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_count(color = "#663399")

```

<a name="viridis"></a>
Alternatively, you can transform your data to create a count column and use the 
count to set the dot colour.

```{r overlap_colour}

overlap %>%
  group_by(x, y) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color=count)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_color_viridis()

```

<p class="alert alert-info">The [viridis package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) 
changes the colour themes to be easier to read by people with colourblindness 
and to print better in greyscale. Use `scale_color_viridis()` to set the colour 
palette and `scale_fill_viridis()` to set the fill palette in ggplot. If you need 
discrete (as opposed to continuous) colours, use `scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE)` 
or `scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE)` instead.</p> 



### Overlapping Continuous Data

Even if the variables are continuous, overplotting might obscure any relationships 
if you have lots of data.

```{r overplot-point}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

<a name="geom_density2d"></a>
Use `geom_density2d()` to create a contour map.

```{r density2d}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_density2d()
```

You can use `stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon")` to create 
a heatmap-style density plot. 

```{r density2d-fill}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon") +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```


<a name="geom_bin2d"></a>
Use `geom_bin2d()` to create a rectangular heatmap of bin counts. Set the 
`binwidth` to the x and y dimensions to capture in each box.

```{r bin2d}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_bin2d(binwidth = c(1,1))
```

<a name="geom_hex"></a>
Use `geomhex()` to create a hexagonal heatmap of bin counts. Adjust the 
`binwidth`, `xlim()`, `ylim()` and/or the figure dimensions to make the hexagons 
more or less stretched.

```{r overplot-hex, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
overplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_hex(binwidth = c(0.25, 0.25))
```

### Heat map
<a name="geom_tile"></a>
I've included the code for creating a correlation matrix from a table of variables, 
but you don't need to understand how this is done yet. We'll cover `mutate` and 
`gather` functions in the `dplyr` and `tidyr` lessons.

```{r}
# generate two sets of correlated variables (a and b)
heatmap <- tibble(
  a1 = rnorm(100),
  b1 = rnorm(100)
) %>% 
mutate(
  a2 = a1 + rnorm(100),
  a3 = a1 + rnorm(100),
  a4 = a1 + rnorm(100),
  b2 = b1 + rnorm(100),
  b3 = b1 + rnorm(100),
  b4 = b1 + rnorm(100)
) %>%
cor() %>% # create the correlation matrix
as.data.frame() %>% # make it a data frame
rownames_to_column(var = "V1") %>% # set rownames as V1
gather("V2", "r", a1:b4) # wide to long (V2)
```

Once you have a correlation matrix in the correct (long) format, it's easy to 
make a heatmap using `geom_tile()`.

```{r heatmap}
ggplot(heatmap, aes(V1, V2, fill=r)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

<p class="alert alert-info">The file type is set from the filename suffix, or by 
specifying the argument `device`, which can take the following values: 
"eps", "ps", "tex", "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf".</p>

### Interactive Plots
<a name="plotly"></a>
You can use the `plotly` package to make interactive graphs. Just assign your 
ggplot to a variable and use the function `ggplotly()`.

```{r plotly, message = FALSE}

demog_plot <- ggplot(demog, aes(age, height, fill=sex)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width= 0.2, height = 0), size = 2)

ggplotly(demog_plot)

```

<p class="alert alert-info">Hover over the data points above and click on the 
legend items.</p>

## Exercises

### Common Plots

Generate a violin plot, boxplot, histogram, density plot, and column plot for the following data. 

```{r}

# dog weights estimated from http://petobesityprevention.org/ideal-weight-ranges/

dogs <- tibble(
  breed = rep(c("beagle", "boxer", "bulldog"), each = 100),
  weight = c(
    rnorm(100, 24, 6),
    rnorm(100, 62.5, 12.5),
    rnorm(100, 45, 5)
  )
)

```

*Basic*: Create each plot.

*Intermediate*: Change the axis labels and colours. Save each plot as a PNG file.

*Advanced*: Create a grid of different plot styles. In your RMarkdown file, 
display just the graph, but not the `r` code for the graph.

  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd), width = 0.25)
```
</div>

### Two continuous variables

Represent the relationships among moral, sexual and pathogen disgust scores from the dataset [disgust_scores.csv](data/disgust_scores.csv). 

*Basic*: Graph the linear relationship between moral and pathogen disgust. Make sure the 
axes run from the minimum to maximum possible scores on both axes. Give the 
graph an appropriate title and axis lables.
  
<div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
```{r exercise-cor-basic, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

disgust <- read_csv("data/disgust_scores.csv")

ggplot(disgust, aes(moral, pathogen)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Moral vs Pathogen",
    x = "Moral Disgust Score",
    y = "Pathogen Disgust Score"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 6) + ylim(0, 6)

```
</div>
  
*Intermediate*: Create a 2d density plot of the relationship between pathogen and sexual disgust. 

Use `stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon", n = ?, 
h = c(?, ?))`, set n and h to values that make the graph look good, and 
figure out what `n` and `h` represent.

<div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>

* `n` changes the smoothness of the contours (number of grid points in each direction)
* `h` changes how densely the contours are drawn (bandwidth)

```{r exercise-density2d}
ggplot(disgust, aes(pathogen, sexual)) +
  stat_density_2d(
    aes(fill = ..level..), 
    geom = "polygon", 
    n = 100, 
    h = c(1, 1)
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis()
```
</div>

*Advanced*: Create a 3x3 grid of plots with columns representing the x-axis and 
rows representing the y-axis. Put a density plot of each variable along the 
diagonal. Make sure the graphs have appropriate titles and axis labels and 
that the range of the axes are the same in all graphs.

|              | moral   | sexual  | pathogen |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **moral**    | density | line    | line     | 
| **sexual**   | line    | density | line     |
| **pathogen** | line    | line    | density  |

### Many correlated variables

*Basic*: Create a heatmap of the relationships among all the questions in 
[disgust_cors.csv](data/disgust_cors.csv) 
(the correlations have already been calculated for you). 

*Intermediate*: Figure out how to rotate the text on the x-axis so it's readable.

<div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
```{r exercise-heatmap}
read_csv("data/disgust_cors.csv") %>%
  ggplot(aes(V1, V2, fill=r)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))
```
</div>
