title: "The Research Cycle"
authors: "Dale Barr & Lisa DeBruine"
---

This course provides an overview of the various stages in the life cycle of a 
research project, with an emphasis on reproducible research and open science 
using the statistical programming language R.  Students will learn about data 
visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and functions, 
probability and data simulations, and general linear models. Learning is 
reinforced through weekly assignments that involve working with different types 
of data.

It will run from 2017-09-22 to 2017-11-24 on Fridays from 10-12 in 
[Boyd Orr 520](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1Zdd1zxeex09Awbz3t1Mm4KEvxKI&hl=en&ll=55.87327%2C-4.292779&z=17).

It is taught by [Dale Barr](http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/) and [Lisa DeBruine](http://facelab.org/debruine).


## Course Aims

This course aims to teach students the basic principles of reproducible research 
and to provide practical training in data processing and analysis in the 
statistical programming language R.


## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* formulate a research design appropriate to various kinds of questions in psychology and neuroscience;
* write scripts in R to organise and transform data sets using best accepted practices;
* explain basics of probability and its role in statistical inference;
* analyse data and report descriptive and inferential statistics in a reproducible manner.
